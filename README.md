FIFA-21-DATA-CLEANING-
FIFA 2021 Dataset Cleaning/Wrangling using Python Programming Language On Jupyter Notebook IDE
Background 
A Challenging Prompt on a data Cleaning Excercise was adopted among Junior, Intermediate and Senior data Analyst in a data-tech space.
The Project was aimed at transforming the FIFA 2021 Dataset into a clean and ready dataset for Exploratory data analysis.
I was able to transform the data using tools such as Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda IDE, Sourced dataset from www.kaggle.com
and the python programming language.
 
 DATA DESCRIPTION.
 
 
 
 The raw FIFA21 dataset was Sourced from www.kaggle.com contains two csv files named FiFa21 raw data v2.csv and Fifa21_raw_data.csv 
 The Former was used for the sake of this project.
 The Fifa2021 raw data v2.csv file contains 18,979 rows and 77 columns. it contains Information about football players and their abilities upto 2021.
 
 DATA CLEANING
 
 
 
 The objective is to ensure that the data quality is improved to ensure accurate, complete, valid and consistent dataset suitable for data analysis.
 
 DATA TRANSFORMATION
 
 
 
 The Data cleaning process was carried out in Jupyter notebook, an Integrated development Environment of the Anaconda Framework. the raw dataset consistent with Quirks, Nuances and irregularities. the code Above shows the Step by step approach to obtaining a clear and concise data cleaning process outputing a Clean dataset ready for Exploratory data analysis and optimisation.
